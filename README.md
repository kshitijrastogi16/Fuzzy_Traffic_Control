# Fuzzy Traffic Control

This project is a simulation of traffic control using fuzzy logic implemented in Python. The aim of this project is to model an intelligent traffic control system that dynamically adjusts traffic signals based on real-time traffic conditions. Fuzzy logic is employed to handle the uncertainty and imprecision inherent in traffic flow.

## **Features:**

- Simulation of multiple intersections with varying traffic densities.
- Real-time adjustment of traffic signal timings based on fuzzy logic.
- Visualization of traffic flow and signal changes.

## **Requirements:**

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: numpy, scikit-fuzzy, matplotlib, pygame

Adjust simulation parameters (if necessary) such as traffic density, intersection layout, etc. in the code.

View the simulation output to observe traffic flow and signal changes.

## **Project Structure:**

- **simulation.py:** Main script containing the traffic simulation logic.
- **utils.py:** Utility functions for traffic simulation.
- **fuzzy_logic.py:** Implementation of fuzzy logic for traffic signal control.
- **main.py:** Functions for visualizing simulation results.
